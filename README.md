# Memory game

My take on the classic tiles memory game. This one has a timer built in, so you have to be fast! 3 levels of difficulty, 3 different tilesets, so that you do not get bored right away. Music and sound effects (optional).

## About

One of my first projects created while learning HTML/CSS/JS. The goal was to create a fun little game with my own twist. The backbone of the project is CSS Grid, which makes it easy to present all the tiles and rearrange them if necessary (for different screen sizes). Made completely from scratch.


#### Main features
* a puzzle game which rewards fast and accurate memory recall
* 3 difficulty levels: easy (16 tiles), medium (24 tiles) and hard (36 tiles)
* 3 different sets of tiles: "birds", "sci-fi" and "forest animals"
* music and sound
* options panel at the top of the page
* simple retro/arcade'y design
* victory screen modal with a points system and a star rating system
* responsive, actually fun on mobile (tested with my daughter ;) )
